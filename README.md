# Data Visualization Portal
## About GeneLab
GeneLab is an open-access resource that enables scientists to upload, store, share, and analyze omics data from spaceflight experiments. It facilitates information sharing, fosters innovation, and accelerates scientific discovery in space biology. By studying the effects of microgravity and space environment on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, GeneLab contributes to our understanding of biology, and advances in genomics. It provides coordinated data sets and metadata, allowing users to gain comprehensive insights and make novel discoveries. GeneLab's impact lies in its ability to facilitate information sharing, drive innovation, and ultimately expand our knowledge of how space conditions affect the fundamental building blocks of life.
## About Data Visualization
GeneLab has a Data Visualiation portal that provides users have the ability to interact with the processed data from space related studies within GeneLab's database. The portal encompasses various visualization types, including Gene Expression query tables, Dendrograms, Heatmaps, Ideogram, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and a range of interactive plots including PCA plots, Pair plots, and Volcano plots. Each tool offers researchers flexibility to adjust parameters and explore specific aspects of the data effectively.
## PCA Plots
### *What is it? Why is it useful?*
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, and this type of plot is used to reduce the dimensionality of large sets of data to simplify the process of analyzing the data points.

### *How do you use it?*
*2D vs 3D visualization* Each PCA plot will include options for a 2D and 3D representation of the data. The default selection is a 3D representation on an "X", "Y", and "Z" axis.

In the upper left corner of the plot area select the "2D" button and then press "Update"

The graph will update to display the data on an "X", and "Y" axis only.

*Color by Factor*

The "Color by Factor" feature allows users to select a specific factor from the study for representation on the graph to allow for an easier comparison between differences in the data.

Select the "Color by Facor" drop down menu

Within the drop down menu select one factor, then press the "Update" button

The results will now be represented by colors matching the factor that was selected.

In this example (GLDS-154) the colors are representing the cell lines and clearly shows how the cell lines could be a factor in the differences between the data points.

*Click on factor labels to hide/unhide*

Another feature within the PCA plot tool allows users to hide factors by selecting the label located on the right side of the plot.

In this example (GLDS-154), the two labels provided are the cell lines "GM15036" which is represented by the color blue, and "GM15510" represented by the color orange.

Click on the label "GM15036" and the data points will be hidden as shown below

Click on the label "GM15036" a second time and the data will return.
